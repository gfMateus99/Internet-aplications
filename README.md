# Internet applications Project 

Repository with the final project of internet applications course (2021/2022). (Politechnika Pozna≈Ñska (Poland) University)

**Project description:** The aim of this project is to create an online tournament system. The system should allow its users to conduct tournaments in a discipline selected by students. The organizers can set a time and place of the tournament, limits on the number of participants and sponsor logos while competitors can apply to participate and enter the results of their encounters.


## Overview

Project created in react, with the database host in Google Firebase. This project aimed to develop an app where students could create and participate in tournaments. Students participating in tournaments could insert the results of each game, and if both results of students were compatible, the students that won could advance to the next phase.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
